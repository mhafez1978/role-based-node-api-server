# Welcome to my repo
In this project my main interest or  goal is to create an restful API that uses a role based access control mechanism to redirect users based on their roles to certain pages.

The stack used so far:
- Node/Express
- MongoDB
- EJS/Bootstrap
- Dotenv/Nodemon (dev)
- More to come ...

To install this project download or clone to your local machine then run npm install from the main app src folder

I am hoping to be able to re-use concepts learned here into my microservices SchoolCMS project.
